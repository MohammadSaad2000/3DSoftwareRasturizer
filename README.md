# 3DSoftwareRasturizer

This is a 3D software rasturizer I created so that I can understand how the math and algorithmm behind 3D computer graphics work.
This project uses JavaFX's Canvas class to draw pixels to the screen. All 3D math and algorithms (such as drawing a triangle on screen) are done manually.
This rasturizer also allows you to import basic OBJ files and view them in a 3D port.
To control the camera: use middle mouse button to rotate view, and WASD to move.
